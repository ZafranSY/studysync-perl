StudySync Perl Backend
Overview
The StudySync Perl Backend provides the server-side logic and database integration for the StudySync platform. Built using Mojolicious, this backend ensures efficient handling of academic data and seamless communication between students and lecturers.

Goals
Reliability: Provides a robust backend to handle API requests and ensure seamless data transfer.
Integration: Manages interactions with the MariaDB database for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
Scalability: Designed to support a growing number of users and interactions.
Features
RESTful APIs: Endpoints for managing user authentication, notifications, and updates.
Database Integration: Efficient CRUD operations with MariaDB.
Real-time Communication: Supports instant updates through WebSocket integration.
Secure Data Handling: Implements secure practices for data access and user management.
Prerequisites
WSL or Docker with mariadb:latest.
Perl (5.10 or later).

## Testing
### API Testing
1. **Using `postTest.js`:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
     ```bash
     node postTest.js
     ```

2. **Using `curl`:**
   - Example `curl` command for testing:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:80/api/exampleEndpoint -d '{"key":"value"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     ```

3. **Using Postman:**
   - Import API details into Postman and test endpoints interactively.
