# StudySync Perl Backend

---

## Overview
The **StudySync Perl Backend** provides the server-side logic and database integration for the StudySync platform. Built using **Mojolicious**, this backend ensures efficient handling of academic data and seamless communication between students and lecturers.

---

## Goals
1. **Reliability:** Provides a robust backend to handle API requests and ensure seamless data transfer.
2. **Integration:** Manages interactions with the **MariaDB** database for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
3. **Scalability:** Designed to support a growing number of users and interactions.

---

## Features
- **RESTful APIs:** Endpoints for managing user authentication, notifications, and updates.
- **Database Integration:** Efficient CRUD operations with MariaDB.
- **Real-time Communication:** Supports instant updates through WebSocket integration.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Implements secure practices for data access and user management.

---

## Prerequisites
- **WSL** or **Docker** with `mariadb:latest`.
- Perl (5.10 or later).
- Mojolicious framework.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/studysync-perl.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd studysync-perl
   ```

3. Set up MariaDB using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run --name studysync-mariadb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=yourpassword -e MYSQL_DATABASE=studysync -p 3306:3306 -d mariadb:latest
   ```

4. Install Perl dependencies:
   ```bash
   cpan Mojolicious DBI DBD::mysql
   ```

5. Configure the database connection in `config/database.conf`:
   ```ini
   [database]
   host = 127.0.0.1
   port = 3306
   user = root
   password = yourpassword
   database = studysync
   ```

---

## Running the Server

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   perl working.pl daemon -l http://*:80

   ```

2. The server will be accessible at:
   ```
   http://localhost:80
   ```

3. Use tools like **Postman** or a web browser to test API endpoints.

---

## Usage

- After setting up, the backend will:
  1. Handle API requests from the Vue.js frontend.
  2. Manage real-time notifications and data synchronization.
  3. Provide endpoints for user management, updates, and forums.

---

## Folder Structure
- **`/lib`**: Contains Mojolicious controllers and helpers.
- **`/public`**: Static assets like images and JavaScript files.
- **`/templates`**: Embedded Perl (EP) templates for rendering views.
- **`/config`**: Configuration files, including database settings.

---

## API Documentation
Visit the `/api-docs` endpoint after running the server to access the detailed API documentation.

- **`.dockerignore`**
  - Specifies files and directories to ignore when building Docker images.

- **`.gitattributes`**
  - Defines repository attributes for handling files (e.g., line endings).

- **`.github`**
  - Contains GitHub-specific configurations, such as workflows for CI/CD.

- **`Dockerfile`**
  - Used to build the Docker image for the backend.

- **`docker-compose.yml`**
  - Docker Compose configuration file for orchestrating multi-container setups (e.g., backend and database).

- **`README.md`**
  - Project documentation, including setup, features, and usage.

---

### **SQL Files**
- **`createtable.sql`**
  - SQL script for creating the required database tables.

- **`droptable.sql`**
  - SQL script for dropping tables, useful during database resets.

- **`dummydata.sql`**
  - Contains dummy data for populating the database during testing.

---

### **Perl Files**
- **`CRUD.pl`**
  - Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing database records.

- **`server.pl`**
  - Main server script that initializes the Mojolicious application and handles routing.

---

### **JavaScript Files**
- **`postTest.js`**
  - A script for testing API endpoints. Can be executed in Node.js or used as a reference for Postman or `curl`.

- **`tempCodeRunnerFile.js`**
  - Temporary file generated by code editors for testing snippets.

- **`todo.js`**
  - A utility file for tracking features or debugging tasks.

---

### **Other Files**
- **`exampleEndpointOutput.md`**
  - Documents sample outputs from various API endpoints for reference.

---

## Testing
### API Testing
1. **Using `postTest.js`:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
     ```bash
     node postTest.js
     ```

2. **Using `curl`:**
   - Example `curl` command for testing:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:80/api/exampleEndpoint -d '{"key":"value"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
     ```

3. **Using Postman:**
   - Import API details into Postman and test endpoints interactively.

---

## Setup Guide
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/studysync-perl.git
   ```

2. Start the backend using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://localhost:80
   ```
